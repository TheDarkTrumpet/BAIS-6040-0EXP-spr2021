# export/*

## Purpose
This directory contains exported data from the Module06+ modules. This directory is largely intended to be **empty**, minus this file for obvious reasons.

If your git client is flagging files to be added, from this directory, then you're doing something wrong.  Please add the file type to .gitignore.  This shouldn't happen, though.
